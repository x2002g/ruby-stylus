# Ruby Stylus

[![Build Status](https://secure.travis-ci.org/lucasmazza/ruby-stylus.png)](http://travis-ci.org/lucasmazza/ruby-stylus)

`stylus` is a bridge between your Ruby code and the [Stylus](https://github.com/LearnBoost/stylus) library that runs on [node.js](http://nodejs.org). It has support for the Rails 3.1 asset pipeline (thanks to a [Tilt](https://github.com/rtomayko/tilt) Template) and it's backed by the [ExecJS](https://github.com/sstephenson/execjs) gem.

## Installation

Be sure to have [node.js](http://nodejs.org) available on your system, and [npm](npmjs.org) to install the [Stylus](https://github.com/LearnBoost/stylus) package (but you can also do a manual installation).

### With npm

You can make a local install (inside your application folder, so the package will be at `./node_modules`) or a global one (with the `-g` flag). With a global install you will need to make sure that the global installation folder is present at the `NODE_PATH` env variable. A global install will also enable the [Stylus](https://github.com/LearnBoost/stylus) command line interface.

### Manual

You can clone Stylus [git repository](http://github.com/learnboost/stylus) into `node_modules/stylus`. Any `node` commands and/or shells from the current directory will be able to find the cloned package.

Check your installation with `node -e "require('stylus')"`. It should print something like [this](https://gist.github.com/1182631) and exit successfully.

## Usage

The interaction is done by the `Stylus` module. You can compile stylus syntax to CSS, convert it back, enable plugins and tweak some other options:

```ruby
require 'stylus'

# Accepts a raw string or an IO object (File, StringIO or anything that responds to 'read').
Stylus.compile(File.new('application.styl')) # returns the compiled stylesheet.

# Using the compress option, removing most newlines from the code.
Stylus.compile(File.read('application.styl'), :compress => true)

# Or use the global compress flag
Stylus.compress = true
Stylus.compile(File.read('application.styl'))

# Converting old and boring CSS to awesome Stylus.
Stylus.convert(File.new('file.css'))

# Importing plugins directly from Node.js, like nib.
Stylus.use :nib

# Enabling debug info, which sends the 'linenos' and 'firebug' options to Stylus.
# If you provide a raw content String to the `Stylus.compile` method, remember to send
# a `:filename` option so Stylus can locate your stylesheet for proper inspection.
Stylus.debug = true
```
### With the Rails 3.1 Asset Pipeline.

Adding `stylus` to your Gemfile should let you work with `.styl` files with the Rails 3.1 Pipeline. Any asset generated with `rails generate` will be created with a `.css.styl` extension.

While [Stylus](https://github.com/LearnBoost/stylus) has a `@import` directive, inside a Rails application you should use the `//= require` directive from Sprockets, so the caching mechanism will look after the changes made on the required file. If you're using mixins (for vendor prefixes or any common statements) or plugins inside your `.styl` files, you should use [Stylus](https://github.com/LearnBoost/stylus) `@import` **and** Sprockets `//= depend_on`. The latter is to ensure the proper dependency management on the Sprockets side.

Any `.styl` file on the Sprockets load path (`app/assets`, `lib/assets`, `vendor/assets` or `assets` folder inside any other gem) will be available via the `@import` directive.

If the `config.assets.debug` is turned on, Stylus will emit exta comments on your stylesheets to help debugging and inspection using the `linenos` and `firebug` options. Check the [FireStylus extension for Firebug](https://github.com/LearnBoost/stylus/blob/master/docs/firebug.md) for more info.

## Plugins

[Stylus](https://github.com/LearnBoost/stylus) exposes a nice API to create plugins written on [node.js](http://nodejs.org), like [nib](https://github.com/visionmedia/nib). The installation process should be same as described above for [Stylus](https://github.com/LearnBoost/stylus) (since they're all npm packages after all). You can hook them'up on your Ruby code with `Stylus.use`:

```ruby
Stylus.use :fingerprint, :literal => 'caa8c262e23268d2a7062c6217202343b84f472b'
```

Will run something like this on javascript:

```javascript
stylus(file).use(fingerprint({literal:'caa8c262e23268d2a7062c6217202343b84f472b'}));
```
